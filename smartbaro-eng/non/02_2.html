                    <li><strong class="feb">Four-zero nerve linear surgery(Navi)</strong><br>The four- zero navi surgery inserts a 2mm catheter into the tail bone canal to gain approach to the diseased area. Tissues are removedwhich 
compresses normal tissue. Navisurgery generates little normal tissue damage and a fast recovery. It is also adequate to spinal disc, neck disc, 
spinal stenosis patients and even women who are afraid of the scars from surgery because of the affect that it will have on their beauty. <br>
Patients can return to normal daily activities after the surgery.

                    <li class="mt10"><strong class="feb">FIMStherapy for disc and adhesion treatment</strong><br>FIMS therapyin combination with the C-arm is an efficient way to cure nerve synechia and inflammation. It widens the narrowed gap between 
discs and separatesdiscs from the nerve with a special needle.

                    </li>
                    <li class="mt10"><strong class="feb">RF nucleus pulposus decompression with one push </strong><br>This new technique inserts an RF needle into a diseased disc and covers fractured tissue. After that, it applies around 50 calcium degrees of 
RF thermal heat to the zone for 5-10 minutes. In turn, it alleviates pain by curing abnormal nerves and fractured tissue and reconstructs some 
discs by contracting them.

                    <li class="mt10"><strong class="feb">Extradural nerve block surgery for repeated chronic neck and back pain</strong><br>Nerve block surgery usually involvesone injection. However, in some cases a thin tube is inserted into the extradural space and drugs are 
continuously injected.

successful. It is an accurate 3-D disc treatment that controls the negative pressure between discs and correctsthe pelvis.
