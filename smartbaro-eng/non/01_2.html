                    This technology involvesphysically changingthe nerve cell membrane so that the brain is not aware of the pain. 
It alleviates pain by inducing a chemical shift and compound formation. ESWT promotes new blood flow and 
regenerates tissues. In particular, it is a therapythat efficientlycures damaged tendons.

                   Hyperbaric oxygen therapy provides cells with more oxygen and restores oxygen to oxygen depleted areas. <br>
When there amputated limbs have been replanted, there has been muscle or ligament damage, during the time 
period from the inflammatory to the recoveryperiod, the oxygen supply is replenished and recovery is promoted. <br>
Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is helpful after a sporting eventsin that it can encourage fast recovery, boost energy, 
strengthenworn-out muscle, burn fat and improve exercise capacity.
