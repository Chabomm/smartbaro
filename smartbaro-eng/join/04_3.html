                <li>This reinforcement method is appropriate for patients undergoing surgical procedures that preserve normal tissues since the posterior has supplies
                    ligament tissues, regenerative tissues and functional knee nervous tissues with plenty of blood unlike the case of the anterior ligament. However,
                    it requires high-level of surgical technique.Nevertheless, it is commonly used to perform reconstruction after removing normal tissues.</li>
