            <p>Calcitic tendinitis is a disorder characterized by deposits of hydroxyapatite in a tendon of the shoulderand is accompanied by severe pain. 
Patients are not able to sleep at night because of the shoulder pain. Several different types of phosphates may be generated at the same time and 
the size thereof is different. The cause of the disorder is the hydroxyapatite deposits in the tendon as a result of degenerative damage.
