            <ul class="bul01">
                <li>Conservative treatmentsinclude non-steroid anti-inflammatory agents, steroid related drug injection, physical therapy, etc. Patients can perform
                    activities which do not cause pain but refrain from activities or motionsthat result in pain when the conservative treatment is being administered.
                    It is appropriate to start sports treatment to help the rotator cuff recover its function. Patients should consider this surgery if there has been no
                    improvement after several months of treatment.
