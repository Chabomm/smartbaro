                <p class="img"><img src="../img/join/01_4_img01.jpg" alt=""></p>The ankle joint plays a critical role in shifting weight in a way similar to the hip bone and knee joint. <br>
The joint thickness of the hip bone and knee is around 6mm, but the ankle thickness is just around 2mm. <br>
Nevertheless, it has a tensile force three to four times stronger than other joints which makesit is resistant to injuries. 
Ankle arthroplasty is necessary, if there is severe degenerative arthritis after an invasive fracture and when medication and other conservative treatments no longer provide any benefit.
