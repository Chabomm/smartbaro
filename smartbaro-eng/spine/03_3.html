            <ul class="bul01 ">
                <li>It is possible to easily bend back after insertingthe artificial disc and fast recovery is possible without the sensation of there being a foreign body
                    present.
                </li>
                <li>Thanks to laparoscopetechniques, the surgery can be performed under only local anesthesia.</li>
                <li>More than one year is required to recover from conventional spinal fusion surgery,including a two-month assist period and a two-week hospitalstay.
                    On the other hand, artificial disc replacement enables patients to be dischargedwithin 2-3 days and return to their normal daily activities one week
                    after surgery.
