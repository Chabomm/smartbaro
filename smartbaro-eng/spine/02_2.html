            <ul class="bul01">
                <li>The incision on the skin and related muscle damage are minimized compared to conventional surgery. So patients feel less pain and don’t have to 
be hospitalized for a long period of time becausethey recover rapidly.
</li>
                <li>Blood transfusion isn’t necessary because only a small amount of blood is lost. The risk of nerve damage is reduced as nerve traction in the middle 
of operation is minimal thanks to the foraminotomy approach.
</li>
                <li>Other tunnelsare approachedif 2*2 spine fixation is performed. Adhesion caused by previous surgeries are avoided.</li>
                <li>After operating, muscle strength is easy to recover and there is less muscle stiffness</li>
