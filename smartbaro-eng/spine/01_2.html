            <ul class="bul01">
                <li>This surgery only takes about one to two hours, and is beneficial to the weak or old people who are not resistant to general anesthesia and do not desire to undergo a complete operation.</li>
                <li>The skin incision is only about 1.5cm –2cm in the case of one disc, while conventional surgery creates a large incision on the skin using the naked
                    eye. This surgical method reduces blood loss and scarring.</li>
                <li>The microscopemakes surgery safe.</li>
                <li>Damage to related normal tissues is minimized thanks to the microscope, precision laser and small surgical tools.</li>
                <li>After surgery, patients don’t have to be hospitalized for a long time because there is less pain. Also, they can rapidly return to their normal daily activities.</li>
